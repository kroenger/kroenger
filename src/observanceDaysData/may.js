        promote sustainable fishing practices, and encourage collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the 
        future of tuna populations. When shopping look for the MSC blue fish tick label when shopping for tuna 
        products, which indicates that they come from fisheries that meet the highest standards of sustainability 
        and traceability.  There are seven species of tuna, and they are found in all the major oceans of the world, 
        except for the polar regions.`

        description: ` The theme for this year is Plant Health for Environmental Protection.
        Using natural pesticides or other environmentally friendly methods prevents or controls plant pests and 
        diseases, rather than relying on chemicals that can harm plants, soil, water, and biodiversity. Protecting 
        plant health is a shared responsibility that requires cooperation and coordination among different actors, 
        such as farmers, gardeners, researchers, policymakers, traders, consumers, and international organizations.`

        description: `This year’s theme is "Water: Sustaining Bird Life". The vast majority of migratory 
        birds rely on aquatic ecosystems during their life cycles. Inland and coastal wetlands, rivers, 
        lakes, streams, marshes, and ponds are all vital for feeding, drinking, or nesting, and also as 
        places to rest and refuel during their long journeys. Unfortunately, aquatic ecosystems are becoming 
        increasingly threatened around the world and so are the migratory birds that depend on them.`

        or even fail to produce at all. We can all help by supporting organic and sustainable farming practices, planting bee-friendly plants in our gardens and balconies, 
        avoiding or minimizing pesticide use, and providing water and shelter for bees.`

        to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity(COP-15) where the Kunming - Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was adopted. This global framework plans 
        to conserve and restore nature by 2030 and beyond. The theme also emphasizes the need to shift from agreement to action and implement the framework in order

        The 2023 campaign also aims to expose the tobacco industry’s efforts to interfere with attempts to substitute tobacco growing with sustainable crops, 
        thereby contributing to the global food crisis. Tobacco growing and production exacerbates food insecurity, soil degradation, deforestation, and desertification.`
