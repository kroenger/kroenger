        Penguins are fascinating and adorable creatures, but they are also facing many threats, 
        such as climate change, overfishing, pollution, and predators. The world’s second-largest 
        colony of emperor penguins has nearly disappeared after changes in sea/ice conditions made 
        their breeding ground unstable. The species might lose anywhere between 50% and 70% of its 
        global population by the end of this century.`

        description: `This day intends to change the way countries around the world operate by raising public awareness 
        to the point where governments will support anti-emission measures. Since CO2 is such a big contributor to 
        climate change, this event seeks to aid the world’s transition to a cleaner environment. The awareness of the 
        need to reduce greenhouse gas or CO2 emissions has been on the radar of scientists for more than 100 years.`
