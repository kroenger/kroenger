        Penguins are fascinating and adorable creatures, but they are also facing many threats, 
        such as climate change, overfishing, pollution, and predators. The world’s second-largest 
        colony of emperor penguins has nearly disappeared after changes in sea/ice conditions made 
        their breeding ground unstable. The species might lose anywhere between 50% and 70% of its 
        global population by the end of this century.`,
