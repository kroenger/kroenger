        day: "International Primate Day",
        description: `Established in 2005 by Animal Defenders International (ADI) to promote the humane treatment of primates and raise 
        awareness about their endangerment. They are essential for seed dispersal, which helps maintain forest biodiversity. Their feeding 
        habits contribute to the growth and regeneration of tropical forests. The presence and health of primate populations can indicate 
        the overall health of their habitats.`

        date: "First Saturday of September",
        day: "International Vulture Awareness Day",
        description: `Vultures are ecologically vital and are now the most threatened group of birds in the world; populations of many species are under 
        pressure and some are facing extinction. Vultures are often misunderstood, but they are essential for maintaining healthy environments by consuming 
        carcasses and preventing the spread of diseases1. Unfortunately, vulture populations are declining globally due to poisoning, habitat loss, and other threats`

        day: "World Coconut Day",
        description: `Coconuts are incredibly versatile, used in food, cosmetics, and even construction materials. By providing a stable source of income, 
        coconut farming supports the livelihoods of millions of people in tropical regions, helping communities become more resilient to the economic 
        impacts of climate change. Coconut-based ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon. Intercropping coconuts with other 
        plants can enhance carbon storage and improve the overall resilience of the ecosystem.`

        date: "7 September",
        day: "International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies",
        description: `Air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths annually and has significant impacts on climate change, economic losses, and agricultural productivity.
        Pollutants like black carbon and methane contribute to global warming. They alter weather patterns and increase the frequency of extreme weather events.
        Efforts to combat air pollution include international agreements like the Paris Agreement, national policies to reduce emissions, and local initiatives to promote clean energy and sustainable practices.`

        date: "12 September",
        day: "World Dolphin Day",
        description: ` This day was established to raise awareness about the need to protect dolphins and to commemorate the tragic event on September 12, 2021, 
        when 1,428 dolphins were killed in the Faroe Islands. Dolphins are considered indicator species, meaning their health reflects the overall health of the 
        marine environment. Monitoring dolphin populations can provide insights into the state of marine ecosystems. As apex predators, dolphins help regulate the 
        populations of fish and squid, ensuring a balanced food web.`

        date: "16 September",
        day: "World Ozone Day",
        description: `The ozone layer absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation, which heats the stratosphere. Ozone depletion leads to cooling of the stratosphere but can 
        contribute to warming in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere) due to increased greenhouse gases. Ozone depletion has a negative radiative forcing 
        effect, meaning it tends to cool the Earth’s surface`

        date: "Third Saturday of September ",
        day: "International Red Panda Day",
        description: `Red pandas are native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China, where they live in high-altitude temperate forests with bamboo understory. 
        They face threats from deforestation, fragmentation, and degradation of their forest home, as well as from hunting for their fur and body parts, 
        and also vulnerable to diseases and parasites and have low reproductive rates. Help them by donating to organisations such as The Red Panda Network, 
        an organization that works to conserve the red panda and its habitat in Nepal and other countries.`

        date: "Third Saturday of September",
        day: " International Coastal Cleanup Day",
        description: `A global event that engages volunteers to remove trash from the world’s beaches and waterways. In addition to cleaning beaches and waterways, 
        volunteers contribute to the world’s largest database on marine debris. Marine debris is one of the greatest threats our ocean faces, but luckily it is an 
        issue with which we can all play a part in the solution.`

        date: "Septemeber 17",
        day: "World Manta Day",
        description: `Manta rays are close relatives of all sharks and rays, meaning they have a skeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. Unsustainable and 
        unregulated tourism can drive mantas away from important cleaning and feeding sites through overcrowding and poor in-water behaviour. Climate breakdown 
        threatens to change the distribution and abundance of zooplankton which mantas feed on. `

        date: "September 18",
        day: "World Water Monitoring Day",
        description: `The day aims to raise awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world by empowering citizens to carry out basic 
        monitoring of their local water bodies. Join the observance day celebration by using a simple test kit to sample local water bodies for temperature, acidity (pH), 
        clarity (turbidity) and dissolved oxygen (DO). `

        date: "September 18",
        day: "World Bamboo Day",
        description: `Bamboo is not only a versatile and fast-growing plant but also plays a crucial role in environmental conservation, economic development,  
        and cultural significance. Bamboo’s fast growth rate allows it to sequester carbon efficiently. It can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates  
        comparable to, or even higher than, many tree species. For instance, one hectare of bamboo can sequester about 17 tonnes of carbon annually.`

        date: "21 September",
        day: "Zero Emissions Day",
        description: `Zero emissions play a crucial role in combating climate change. Achieving zero emissions means that no net greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. 
        This can be done by reducing emissions as much as possible and balancing any remaining emissions with actions that remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as planting 
        trees or using carbon capture technologies`

        date: "21 September",
        day: "International Coastal Cleanup Day",
        description: `Marine debris, often referred to as marine litter, has significant and far-reaching impacts on the environment, wildlife, and even human health.
        Many marine animals, including fish, birds, and mammals, mistake debris for food. Ingesting plastic can lead to malnutrition, intestinal blockage, and even death.
        Microplastics, tiny plastic particles resulting from the breakdown of larger debris, can enter the food chain and potentially pose health risks to humans.`

        day: "International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste",
        description: "The goal of this day is to raise awareness of the importance of food loss and waste. Food loss and waste have many negative economic and environmental impacts. When food is wasted, the resources that go into producing and making food available to consumers are also wasted. Reducing food loss and waste can improve food security and nutrition, lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce pressures on natural resources such as land and water."
